# JS-Basics
JavaScript Essentials: A deep dive into core JS concepts including objects, arrays, destructuring, spread/rest operators, template literals, ternary operators, functions, short-circuiting, chaining, array methods (map, filter, reduce, sort), slice &amp; splice, and asynchronous JS (promises &amp; async/await).

## JS-Objects

An object is a collection of key-value pairs, where keys are strings (also called properties), and values can be any data type (strings, numbers, arrays, functions, or even other objects).

**Why Use Objects?**
- They allow you to group related data together.
- They help you structure data in a meaningful way.
- They support methods (functions inside objects) to manipulate data.

## JS-Arrays

An array in JavaScript is a special type of object that can hold multiple values in a single variable. It allows you to store, access, and manipulate collections of data efficiently.
